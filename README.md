# Statistical-Analysis-with-Python
This is the final project for the Statistical Analysis of Medical Data Course from the Master's courses in Biomedical Engineering at Amirkabir University of Technology.

I implemented the statistical analysis of the paper ["Letâ€™s talk over coffee: Exploring the effect of coffee flavour descriptions on
consumer imagery and behaviour"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950329322002324?via%3Dihub) with Python. There are 2 jupyter notebooks and a presentation file besides a Persian report of the project.

## Report file & Jupyter Notebooks:
The final report is in Persian and the English version will be posted here as soon as possible. However, the 2 jupyter notebooks are commented in detail (in English).
